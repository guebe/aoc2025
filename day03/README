My solution takes a window from the left.

The windows size is overall size minus k whereas k is the size of the remaining
digits needed to get a n-digit number (that is n-digit minus 1 for the first
iteration).

In this window from the left the biggest number is chosen. Lets call this
number best.

Now we recurse into finding the best number from the found best position plus
one step right. The number of digits we have to find is one less.

Do this until the best n-digits are found. That is the number of digits we
have to find is 0.

Because we search from the left and we do not consider the digits we still need
to build the biggest n-digit number this algorithm gives an optimal result.
